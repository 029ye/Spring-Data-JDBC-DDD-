# Spring PetClinic Sample Application built with Spring Data JDBC

This is a branch of the official [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application with domain & persistence layer built with [Spring Data JDBC](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jdbc/) instead of [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/).

Check original project [readme](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/master/readme.md) for introduction the project, how to run, and how to contribute.
